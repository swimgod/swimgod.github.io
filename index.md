# **About Me**

Hi, I'm Gary Fong! Welcome to my assortment of projects I have built/planned.

I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) with an emphasis on robotic control systems. I then worked as an electrical engineer on electrical systems for airships/blimps. I made the pivot to software engineering/development in 2018-2019 and have worked on multiple healthcare projects with an emphasis on data engineering with Python and Databricks until 2024. I also worked on a number of small game development projects using C# and C++ throughout this time.

I also enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and basketball.
