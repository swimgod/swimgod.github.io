# **Windwalker**
## Concept to Creation
After the game jam, we wanted to push the limits of our skills a little bit in a bigger game. Paul initially designed the game as a mobile game and we had started developing it for deployment on Android. Originally, this was designed as a mobile game and we were going to utilize Firebase Realtime Database as our storage, with Firebase Cloud Functions to verify the authenticity of the user. We had created an API using NodeJS to interface with Unity initially to make those calls. 

However, after some compatibility issues with the Addressables system and Android deployment, we decided to just push forward and deploy it as a PC game. The main mechanics we wanted to develop were the randomization of loot and turn-based combat. We ended up deploying it onto PC after developing on/off from 2021-2023 and stopped all development. I would say the game is more of a demo to display some mechanics and definitely needs a lot more work to really refine.

## Lore
Windwalker is a 3d turn-based RPG where players collect loot from combat and other encounters to cleanse the plague stirring in the fantastical world of Qubis. Fight against unique monsters with thousands of unique items and acquire powerful pets to fight alongside you.
