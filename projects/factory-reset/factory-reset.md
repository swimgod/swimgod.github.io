# **Factory Reset**
A steampunk ARPG, Path of Exile style game. Play as Rusty, explore the garden, workshop, and make your way through a series of enemies, and test your skills against the final boss, Hammercrank!

Item drops are randomized, you have a 50-50 chance of getting either a sword or musket, with differing rarities (W,G,B,PRP,GOLD), as well as a item level that adjusts stat values of that item. 

At the workbench, you can recycle weapons to potentially get a stronger weapon, at the risk of getting an item with a lower rarity.
