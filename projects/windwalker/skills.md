### Skills

To create a flexible system of skills, we chose to utilize a number of interfaces and composition to create different types of skills. These interfaces allowed us to support the types of skills we wanted. Each skill was also a Scriptable Object that we could then slot into a Job or potentially a weapon to provide access to the skills. This applies to both Passive and Active Skills. 

We didnâ€™t end up implementing any, but the passive skills were setup to be able to execute actions during the upkeep and end states of the player.
